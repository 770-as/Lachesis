macro called DECLARE_CONST_UNICODE_STRING. This does two things: it creates the string and fills it with your text at compile time.
To find your specific volume path, you can use the WinObj tool from Sysinternals or use the QueryDosDevice API, but for a driver developer, the easiest way is to look 
at your kernel logs using DbgPrint.
Since you have your callback running, you can simply print the name of every process that starts. Your DbgPrint will show you exactly how the kernel sees your hard drive.
